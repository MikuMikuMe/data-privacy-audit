Creating a comprehensive data privacy audit tool is a significant task due to the complex and varied nature of data privacy regulations across different regions (such as GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, etc.). Here's a simplified version of a Python application that can serve as a starting point for building a data privacy audit tool. Please note that a real-world application would involve far more complexity, especially in interpreting legal requirements and interacting with various data systems.

This tool will include basic features such as scanning for sensitive data patterns, checking encryption statuses, and assessing data access permissions. This example will focus on file-based data sources for simplicity. Assume the data files are plain text for this simplified version.

```python
import os
import re
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class DataPrivacyAudit:
    def __init__(self, directory):
        self.directory = directory
        self.sensitive_data_patterns = {
            'ssn': r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b',  # Example pattern for US Social Security Numbers
            'credit_card': r'\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b',  # Pattern for credit card numbers
            'email': r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'  # Pattern for email addresses
        }

    def audit(self):
        try:
            for root, _, files in os.walk(self.directory):
                for file in files:
                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                    logging.info(f"Auditing file: {file_path}")
                    self._audit_file(file_path)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error during audit: {e}")

    def _audit_file(self, file_path):
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
                content = f.read()
                self._scan_for_sensitive_data(file_path, content)
                self._check_encryption_status(file_path)
                self._check_permissions(file_path)
        except IOError as e:
            logging.error(f"Could not open or read file {file_path}: {e}")

    def _scan_for_sensitive_data(self, file_path, content):
        try:
            for data_type, pattern in self.sensitive_data_patterns.items():
                matches = re.findall(pattern, content)
                if matches:
                    logging.warning(f"Found {len(matches)} {data_type} entries in {file_path}")
        except re.error as e:
            logging.error(f"Regex error: {e}")

    def _check_encryption_status(self, file_path):
        # This is a placeholder for encryption check.
        # Actual implementation would depend on specific encryption methods being used.
        logging.info(f"Checking encryption status of {file_path}")
        # Example check: assume files larger than 1MB are encrypted
        if os.path.getsize(file_path) > 1024 * 1024:
            logging.info(f"File {file_path} appears to be encrypted based on size heuristic")
        else:
            logging.warning(f"File {file_path} might not be encrypted")

    def _check_permissions(self, file_path):
        try:
            permissions = oct(os.stat(file_path).st_mode)[-3:]
            logging.info(f"Permissions for {file_path}: {permissions}")
            if permissions not in {'600', '640'}:
                logging.warning(f"Permissions for {file_path} are not restrictive enough")
        except OSError as e:
            logging.error(f"Could not determine permissions for file {file_path}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory_to_audit = "path_to_your_directory"  # Replace with the path to the directory you want to audit
    audit_tool = DataPrivacyAudit(directory_to_audit)
    audit_tool.audit()
```

### Key Features of the Program:
1. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Uses the `logging` module to track events during execution.
   - Handles exceptions related to file I/O and regex.

2. **Sensitive Data Scanning**:
   - Uses regex patterns to scan for specific types of sensitive data (SSNs, credit cards, emails).

3. **Encryption Status Check**:
   - Placeholder logic for checking encryption status; assumes files above a certain size are encrypted. In a production environment, this should be replaced with actual encryption checks.

4. **Permissions Check**:
   - Checks file permissions and warns if they are not restrictive. This is a simple check that can be expanded upon depending on specific compliance requirements.

The code is intended to serve as a starting point. Comprehensive auditing requires more sophisticated techniques to handle various data formats and encryption methods, as well as legal consult for compliance checks.
